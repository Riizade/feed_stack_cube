Introduction
===============================================================================
This is a Magic: the Gathering cube meant for drafting. Anything in the "mainboard" is in the cube, and should be 360 cards. Anything in the "sideboard" is meant to be considered for inclusion in the cube after swapping out a similarly colored and costed card, for balance or customization reasons.

This cube is meant to be roughly on par in power level with a typical Standard draft, while keeping the cost down enough that the cube can be purchased in its entirety for less than a typical Standard deck.

File Format
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The file cube.csv holds all of the cube information. This is a MagicAssistant CSV file. When exporting, export with the fields id, name, and set. Uncheck the box that says "Generate header row".

When importing, make sure MagicAssistant knows that it is in fact a MagicAssistant CSV file.

Sorting
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Not needed with a MagicAssistant CSV, as the exported file should always be sorted. You can attempt to sort it for sanity, however.
